How much do wins actually move the needle for college football attendance? Do fans really show up more when their team’s winning — or are some programs just drawing crowds no matter what? I wanted to find out. Using cfbfastR, I pulled every FBS game from 2021–2024 and compared each team’s average home attendance in wins versus losses. The goal was to see where Maryland fits in — and whether its crowds really dip even when things are going right on the field.

```{r}
cfbd_team_info(conference = "B1G")
```

```{r}
b1g_2021 <- cfbd_game_info(year = 2021, conference = "B1G")
b1g_2022 <- cfbd_game_info(year = 2022, conference = "B1G")
b1g_2023 <- cfbd_game_info(year = 2023, conference = "B1G")
b1g_2024 <- cfbd_game_info(year = 2024, conference = "B1G")

b1g <- bind_rows(b1g_2021, b1g_2022, b1g_2023, b1g_2024)
```

```{r}
home <- b1g |>
  mutate(point_diff = home_points - away_points) |>
  filter(!neutral_site, !is.na(attendance))
```

```{r}
home |>
  group_by(win = point_diff > 0) |>
  summarize(avg_attendance = mean(attendance))
```

```{r}
home <- b1g |>
  filter(!neutral_site, !is.na(attendance)) |>
  mutate(win = home_points > away_points)
```

```{r}
team_summary <- home |>
  group_by(home_team, win) |>
  summarize(
    games = n(),
    avg_home_pts = mean(home_points),
    avg_opp_pts  = mean(away_points),
    avg_attendance = mean(attendance)
  ) |>
  arrange(home_team, desc(win))
```

```{r}
big_ten_teams <- c(
  "Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa", "Maryland", "Michigan", "Michigan State",
  "Minnesota", "Nebraska", "Northwestern", "Ohio State", "Penn State",
  "Purdue", "Rutgers", "Wisconsin", "USC", "UCLA", "Oregon", "Washington"
)

b1g_only <- team_summary |> 
  filter(home_team %in% big_ten_teams)
```

```{r}
b1g_only_long <- home |>
  filter(home_team %in% big_ten_teams, !neutral_site, !is.na(attendance)) |>
  mutate(result = if_else(home_points > away_points, "Win", "Loss")) |>
  group_by(home_team, result) |>
  summarize(
    games = n(),
    avg_home_pts = mean(home_points),
    avg_opp_pts  = mean(away_points),
    avg_attendance = mean(attendance)
  ) |>
  arrange(home_team, desc(result))
```


I initially wanted to make a quick, clean visual that compared how Big Ten teams draw fans when they win versus when they lose — just to see if Maryland really stands out for having that weird drop in attendance after wins. The idea was simple: one line per team, connecting average attendance in losses to average attendance in wins.

But once I built it out, it just didn’t hit the way I hoped. The lines were all pretty flat, and it kind of looked cluttered without really emphasizing the main point. Maryland’s drop-off was technically there, but it didn’t stand out — everything blended together. It felt more like a spreadsheet on a chart than a visual that actually tells a story.

  )
```

```{r}
b1g_only_wide <- b1g_only_wide |>
  mutate(
    pct_change = (Win - Loss) / Loss * 100
  )
```

```{r}
b1g_only_wide <- b1g_only_wide |>
  filter(!home_team %in% c("Washington", "Oregon"))
```

This scatterplot compares average home attendance in wins versus losses for Big Ten football teams from 2021 to 2024. Each point represents one program, showing how its home crowds differ based on game outcomes. The strong upward trendline indicates that attendance generally rises for teams when they win. Maryland, highlighted in red, sits below the trend --- signaling that it draws smaller home crowds for wins than most of its Big Ten peers.

This scatterplot compares home attendance in wins versus losses for every FBS football team from 2021 to 2024. Each point represents one program, showing how average crowds change based on game outcomes. The strong diagonal trendline indicates that most teams draw similar attendance regardless of result, with slightly higher crowds in wins. Maryland, highlighted in red, falls below that trend --- showing that its home attendance tends to drop in victories and peak during higher-profile losses.
